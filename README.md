## David White, Joshua Mason, Connor Dolan, Rohan Rao, Jianlin Chen

- **Liaison:** David White
- **Tutor:** Leonardo

This homework aims to port a program written in Lua ([source](https://github.com/txt/se22/blob/main/etc/pdf/csv.pdf)) to Python while using good software engineering practices.
The program reads a CSV file and generate summaries of columns (medians and standard deviation for numerics; mode and entropy for symbolic columns).
